Welcome to Biosim's documentation!
==================================

BioSim is a simulator for population on an island. The program lets you put an initial population of herbivores,
carnivores or both on an island. You can design the island as you wish, within some criteria. The simulation shows:
 * Animal count
      - A graph over total number of animals by species
 * Histograms
      - displaying age, weight and fitness for both species.
 * Counter
      - counts how many years have passed
 * Population density map
      - one for each species. Where the density of population is displayed by different colors and color bars over the years
