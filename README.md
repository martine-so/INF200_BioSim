# BioSim- simulation tool for population

####Author = Karoline Kviserud og Martine Sørgård Olsen

BioSim is a simulator for population on an island. The program lets you put an initial population of herbivores, 
carnivores or both on an island. You can design the island as you wish, within some criteria. The simulation shows:
 * A graph over total number of animals by species 
 * Population map
   - one for each species. Where the density of population is displayed by different colors and color bars over the years
 * Histograms displaying age, weight and fitness for both species. 
 * Counter that counts how many years have passed

How do I use BioSim?
You can use BioSim via Python.

Why should I use BioSim? 
BioSim is an easy and very clear way to visualize how a population behaves over several years. You can control


Visualization of island objects
BioSim package is developed by team A43 for plotting and visualizing a population on an island.
