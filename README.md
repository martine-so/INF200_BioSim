# BioSim- simulation tool for population

####Author = Karoline Kviserud og Martine Sørgård Olsen

BioSim is a simulator for population on an island. The program lets you put an initial population of herbivores, 
carnivores or both on an island. You can design the island as you wish, within some criteria. The simulation shows:
 * A graph over total number of animals by species
 * Histograms displaying age, weight and fitness for both species. 
 * Counter that counts how many years have passed
 * Population map
   - one for each species. Where the density of population is displayed by different colors and color bars over the years

##How do I use BioSim?
You can use BioSim via Python. There you can design your own island. Add the population you wish and change the 
params to match your needs. 


##Why should I use BioSim? 
BioSim is an easy and very clear way to visualize how a population behaves over several years. You can control the size
and geography of the island. In BioSim you can also choose the initial population on the island and where you want to
place them. There are two different species you can place on the island, herbivores and carnivores.
BioSim includes default values for all the params for landscape and animals, or you can easily set the params as you 
please.
BioSim provides a few examples that can help you get started with your own simulation project.
